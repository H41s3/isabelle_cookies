Oatmeal raisin cookies are the perfect combination of wholesome ingredients and sweet indulgence. These cookies are packed with fiber-rich oats, plump raisins, and warm spices that make them irresistible.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar

- 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1 1/2 cups raisins
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Instructions

2. **Whisk together** flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl.

3. **Cream butter and sugars** in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

4. **Beat in eggs** one at a time, then add vanilla extract.

5. **Gradually mix in** the flour mixture until just combined.

6. **Stir in oats**, raisins, and walnuts (if using) by hand.
