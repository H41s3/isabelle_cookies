# Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

There's nothing quite like the smell of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies wafting through the kitchen. This recipe has been perfected over generations and is guaranteed to become a family favorite.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat your oven** to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Mix dry ingredients** in a medium bowl: flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars** in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add eggs and vanilla** one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

5. **Gradually add dry ingredients** to the wet mixture, mixing just until combined.

6. **Fold in chocolate chips** gently to avoid overmixing.

7. **Drop rounded tablespoons** of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake for 9-11 minutes** until edges are golden brown but centers are still soft.

9. **Cool on baking sheets** for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Don't overmix** the dough - this can make cookies tough
- **Use room temperature butter** for proper creaming
- **Don't overbake** - cookies will continue to set as they cool
- **Let cookies cool** completely before storing

## Storage

Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. For longer storage, freeze baked cookies in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months.

## Variations

- **Nuts**: Add 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
- **Different chips**: Try white chocolate, butterscotch, or peanut butter chips
- **M&M's**: Replace chocolate chips with colorful M&M's for a fun twist

This recipe makes about 3 dozen cookies, perfect for sharing with family and friends. The cookies will keep their chewy texture for several days when stored properly.

Happy baking! 🍪
